         title="Dynamic Viewpoints in Archi">
      <description>
        When creating a new View in Archi, the default Viewpoint is set to "None", meaning that all concepts can be added to the View. Setting a Viewpoint on a View means 
        that a sub-set of elements is available to place on the View. Some other ArchiMate authoring tools require you to specify the Viewpoint in advance when 
        creating the View. Unfortunately, this means that you cannot change your mind should you wish to later change the Viewpoint in the View.
        <br/><br/>
        Archi, however, implements <b>Dynamic Viewpoints</b> so that you can change the Viewpoint at any time and those elements that are not permitted for that Viewpoint are "ghosted" out. 
        Dynamic Viewpoints allow you to change your mind. You don't have to decide up-front what the Viewpoint will be. You can experiment with different Viewpoints for the same View. 
        And if you decide to keep the Viewpoint, you can simply remove any disallowed elements from the View.</description>

      <description>
         A viewpoint in ArchiMate is a selection of a relevant subset of the ArchiMate concepts (and their relationships) and the representation of that part of an architecture that is expressed in different diagrams. A set of such viewpoints was developed based on practical experience.

         You should now see the basic folder structure of your new model in the Model Tree.  Also, you should see the <b>Model Diagram Window</b> open. This is where you can visually build your Model by dragging elements and connections from the palette to the diagram.
<br/><br/>
You can also add elements directly to the Model Tree by right-clicking on a folder and selecting the <b>&quot;New&quot;</b> menu action. Once added, the elements can be dragged from the Tree to the Diagram.
